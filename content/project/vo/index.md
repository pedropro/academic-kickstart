<!-- Zero-drift by combining visual odometry with model tracking

A mesh model extruded from a floor plan is rendered through OpenGL for model alignment/tracking with planes and lines while frame-2-frame VO is used for smoothing. Green lines correspond to the mesh edges. Notice how pose errors are corrected.{{< youtube vMsV04emXHU >}} -->
